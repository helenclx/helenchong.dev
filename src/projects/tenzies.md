## Introduction

Tenzies is a dice game that requires the player to roll until all dice are the same. This project is based on the Tenzies Game tutorial from [Scrimba's Learn React course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact).

## Problem Solved

After completing the tutorial to create a Tenzies Game from Scrimba, I made improvements to the game project, including responsive design, accessibility, keeping track of dice roll and time, etc.:

## Technologies Used

This project is built with Vite and React.js.

<!-- ## Challenges Faced

Eget mauris pharetra et ultrices. Molestie nunc non blandit massa enim nec. Ut tortor pretium viverra suspendisse potenti nullam ac tortor vitae. Nulla at volutpat diam ut venenatis. Volutpat ac tincidunt vitae semper quis lectus nulla at. -->

## Lessons Learned

Building a Tenzies game has been a fun way to learn React.js. As I made enhancements to the project, I also practiced responsive and accessible web design.
