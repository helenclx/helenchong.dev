## Introduction

Tenzies is a dice game that requires the player to roll until all dice are the same. This project is based on the Tenzies Game tutorial from [Scrimba's Learn React course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact).

## Problem Solved

After completing the tutorial to create a Tenzies Game from Scrimba, I made improvements to the game project, including responsive design, accessibility, keeping track of dice roll and time, and so on.

Improvements and additional features I made to the game included:
- Putting real dots on the dice using CSS
- Using relative units in CSS
- Making the app responsive to different screen sizes
- Adding dice roll count
- Recording the number of dice rolls and the time it took to win
- Tracking the best records of dice rolls and time taken to win
- Improved accessibility: the entire game can be interacted with key presses, along with clear focus outlines

## Technologies Used

This project is built with Vite and React.js.

## Lessons Learned

Building a Tenzies game has been a fun way to learn React.js. As I made enhancements to the project, I also practiced responsive and accessible web design.
