## Introduction

A WordPress plugin and an add-on to [Long Watch Studio](https://plugins.longwatchstudio.com/)'s [WooRewards](https://plugins.longwatchstudio.com/product/woorewards/) (also known as MyRewards), a [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/) plugin.

Add one-time redeemable vouchers as a reward option in your points and rewards system powered by WooRewards for customers to unlock, with the vouchers being issued by using the [QR Planet API](https://qrplanet.com/qr-code-api). Customers who unlock the voucher reward will receive an email with the voucher's redemption link and instructions to redeem the voucher.

This was the very first WordPress plugin I ever developed.

## Problem Solved

I developed this plugin during my first web developer job, upon my then-employer's request to integrate QR Planet's API into my then-company's WooCommerce website, with a customer points and rewards system powered by WooRewards, to allow customers to unlock one-time redeemable vouchers with reward points.

## Technologies Used

WooRewards Add-On: One-Time Redeemable Voucher is a WordPress plugin built with PHP, CSS and the [QR Planet API](https://qrplanet.com/qr-code-api).

## Challenges Faced

As this was my first time developing a WordPress plugin, I studied a lot about PHP and how to create a WordPress plugin.

## Lessons Learned

Successfully developing my first WordPress plugin was a major step in my web developer journey, by showcasing not only my technical and programming knowledge and skills, but also my learning and problem-solving skills.
