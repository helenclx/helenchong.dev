## Introduction

CS50 Flask Blog is a private blogging application built with Flask, and my final project for [CS50's Introduct6ion to Computer Science 2024](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/).

## Problem Solved

The concept of CS50 Flask Blog was a blogging application that can be run and used on a local machine. In addition, CS50 Flask Blog was designed to prioritise user privacy, as it requires users to create an account and log in to write blog posts, thus making it a good fit for private blog posts.

## Features

- Create a user account with a password
- Write, edit and delete blog posts
- Rich text editor for writing and editing blog posts
- Change username and password

The idea of requiring users to log in to use the application's main functions was inspired by the [Finance problem set](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/9/finance/) from Week 9 of CS50x. I based the code of the user account registration, logging in and logging out functions on the Finance problem set, but the rest of CS50 Flask Blog's code was written from scratch.

To make further good use of the user account feature and the SQL database of CS50 Flask Blog, I also added the ability for users to change their username and password, and use the SQL database to store users' blog posts.

## Technologies Used

CS50 Flask Blog is built with Flask, Python, MySQL, HTML and Bootstrap.
