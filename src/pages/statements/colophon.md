## JavaScript

Due to this website being a static site, JavaScript is used to create dynamic and interactive components of this site. Here is a list of how JavaScript is used on this site:

* Display a "scroll to top" button at the bottom right corner of the screen after scrolling down a page far enough.
* My [contact page](/contact) includes a JavaScript embed of my email contact form powered by [Letterbird](https://letterbird.co/).
* Add buttons to copy code snippets to pages with code blocks.
* Zach Leatherman's [details-utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zachleat/details-utils) JavaScript package is used to automatically expand sidebar table of contents on wide screens.
* [Website Carbon Badge](https://www.websitecarbon.com/badge/), which is placed on the home page, uses JavaScript to calculate the carbon footprint of this website.

You can still access most of the content of this site with JavaScript disabled, but the above components will not work as intended.
