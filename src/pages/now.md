## Other Things I Have Been Doing Recently

I created and released a fork of BellaBuffs, the PHP script for building and managing a fanlisting, an online listing of fans for a particular subject open for fans around the world to join, with PHPMailer integration to power the email sending features.

You can download my BellaBuffs fork and learn about how to use it from [its GitHub repository](https://github.com/helenclx/BellaBuffs-PHPMailer), and read my blog post about it: [Dipping My Toes in PHP for My Hobby Project](/blog/posts/2024-07-08-dipping-my-toes-in-php-for-my-hobby-project).
