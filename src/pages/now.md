## My Current Progress in My Courses

### [Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend):

* Completed Module 9 - Learn UI Design
* Completed Module 10 - React Basics
    * Note: I had completed most of this module and [all the solo projects](https://github.com/helenclx/Scrimba-React-Solo-Projects) form this module in July 2023, before enrolling the Frontend Developer Career Path in January 2024. This time I was merely watching all the updated scrims.

## Other Things I Have Been Doing Recently

* Learning about purchasing and configuring custom domains since [I finally have one now](/blog/posts/2024-05-29-custom-domain-name-helenchong-dev).
