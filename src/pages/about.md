Hi, I am Helen Chong (they/she) from Malaysia. I am a front-end web developer with 8 years of working experience as a graphic designer.

I love to build and create things for problem-solving and self-expression. I intend to transfer my graphic design experience into web design and web development expertise, using code and build sites and apps to solve problems. I have a particular interest on responsive, accessible, inclusive and scalable design to create the best user experience.

In addition to coding and programming, I enjoy gaming, reading, drawing and crocheting.
