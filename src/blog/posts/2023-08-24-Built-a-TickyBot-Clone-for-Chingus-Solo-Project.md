On 11 August 2023, I decided to join [Chingu](https://www.chingu.io/) after discovering its existence through the [Scrimba Podcast](https://www.chingu.io/), specifically [Episode 127](https://scrimba.com/podcast/are-you-a-new-developer-follow-this-one-tip-with-scrimba-student-danny/). I have learned coding since December 2022, and one of the challenges aspiring self-taught developers face is gaining practical experience that can prepare them for developer jobs, so when I discovered Chingu, I thought it could be an opportunity for me to gain experience in working in group developer projects, thus I registered on the platform and joined the Chingu community on Discord.

The first step needed to start participating in Chingu's projects is to submit a solo project for approval. I chose to build a [TickyBot Clone](https://github.com/chingu-voyages/soloproject-tier1-tickybot-clone) using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. On 21 August, I finished coding [my TickyBot Clone](https://github.com/helenclx/TickyBot-Clone) and submitted the project to Chingu. On the next day, my solo project was approved by Chingu, to my great delight.

You can view my TickyBot Clone's [live site](http://helenclx.github.io/TickyBot-Clone/) and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/helenclx/TickyBot-Clone).

My next step was to sign up for the next Chingu Voyage. I am looking forward to learning to work in a group developer project. Wish me luck!
