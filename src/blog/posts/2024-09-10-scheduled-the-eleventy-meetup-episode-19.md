I am pleased to announce that I have been invited to speak at a tech event, by speaking in Episode 19 of [THE Eleventy Meetup](https://11tymeetup.dev/)!

This will also be my first time speaking at a tech event, another major milestone since I [got my first developer job in August 2024](/blog/posts/2024-08-16-got-my-first-developer-job).

Episode 19 of THE Eleventy Meetup is scheduled to be held on 26 September 2024, 7pm Malaysia Time. My talk, titled "Eleventy Journey From 2.0 to 3.0", will be about my experience with using Eleventy, including the decision and process of upgrading to Eleventy 3.0.

I have been using Eleventy since [April 2024](/blog/posts/2024-04-11-rebuilding-my-developer-portfolio-with-eleventy), and loving it and its wonderful community, so I am immensely grateful that my first time speaking at a tech event will be dedicated to Eleventy.
