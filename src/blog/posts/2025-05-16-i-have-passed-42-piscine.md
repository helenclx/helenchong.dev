Finally, after spending 8 hours in average per day studying hard in [42 the computer science school](/blog/topics/42-the-school/)'s 26-day bootcamp, named the Piscine, and two weeks after finishing the Piscine, I succeed in passing the bootcamp, and is qualified for 42's core curriculum! ðŸŽ‰

This was another major milestone for me as a developer, since despite already having experience in programming when attending the bootcamp, the Piscine's curriculum was still no walk in the park. I registered and attending the Piscine because I want to continue to improve myself as a developer, so naturally I hope I can pass the bootcamp and be qualified for 42's core programme. It was a massive relief to realise that my hard work had paid off and got recognised by the school.

At the moment, it is still uncertain when the core programme will start, because my local campus still needs a certain amount of qualified participants from multiple intakes of the Piscine, so there are enough students to start taking the core curriculum together. The campus have planned to hold a new intake of the Piscine in June, so hopefully there will be more people joining us in the core programme.

Interestingly, the email the campus staff sent us to inform us of the results of our Piscine arrived at our mailbox at 4.20 pm (Malaysia Time) sharp. I am almost certain that is intentional, given that the school is literally named 42.

I had decided that regardless of my results of the Piscine, I will continue to make good use of the resources I currently have to keep my computer science and programming knowledge and skills sharp, but passing the Piscine is certainly a great motivator.

Looking forward to 42's core programme!
