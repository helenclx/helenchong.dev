My school, 42 Malaysia, just held a roadshow event on February 27 and 28, 2026.

Two weeks ago, I and two other classmates were invited by the staff of my local campus of 42 Malaysia to take part in a student showcase during the roadshow event, then in last week we joined a session hosted by the campus staff to prepare for our presentation, by giving us guidelines for how to present in the event, such as what to include in our slideshows and speech..

At last, after two weeks of preparation, on the past Wednesday we got the opportunity to present ourselves in front of a bunch of industry partners of our school, mainly from the education industry, to showcase one of our projects and shared our journey at 42 the school.

Fortunately, this was not my first time presenting myself in front of a public; I have had experience doing so in both physical and online events. We needed to deliver our presentation in 5 minutes, so it was not too demanding, and I was fairly satisfied with my performance. After the roadshow event, some members of the 42 Malaysia staff praised my presentation. In conclusion, my presentation was a success!

Side note: At the moment, I am the one who has progressed the furthest in our core curriculum among my classmates, with my current projects being about Python fundamentals.
