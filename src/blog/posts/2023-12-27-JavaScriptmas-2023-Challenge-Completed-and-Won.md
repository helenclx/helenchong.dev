Starting from 1 December 2023, I had participated in [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/)'s [JavaScriptmas](https://scrimba.com/learn/javascriptmas) challenge. After 24 days, I finally completed the entire challenge! I have compiled a [scrim playlist](https://scrimba.com/playlist/pdpB3JZfE) for all my JavaScriptmas solutions on Scrimba.

In addition, when Scrimba announced the winners of JavaScriptmas in their [JavaScriptmas PrizeFest](https://www.youtube.com/live/Y0tc4DTS0e8) livestream on 24 December, it was revealed that [I (under my Twitter handle helen\_clx) was one of the 24 winners of a one-year Scrimba Pro plan](https://www.youtube.com/live/Y0tc4DTS0e8?t=2190) for [my solution to the Day 18 challenge](https://scrimba.com/scrim/co79e43dcbacb329c01a1744f?pl=pdpB3JZfE): AI alt text generator!

JavaScriptmas has been a great opportunity to practice and sharpen my CSS and JavaScript knowledge and skills. The AI challenges, including Day 18, which I won, were also the first time I learned to incorporate AI in coding projects. Therefore, it was a great surprise that I managed to win for an AI challenge.

Thank you Scrimba for the Christmas gift! With a one-year Scrimba Pro plan, I will be able to take Scirmba courses that are only available to subscribers.
