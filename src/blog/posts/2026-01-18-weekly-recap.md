Inspired by the weekly and monthly recap posts by other bloggers, I decided to start writing such form of blog posts myself as a way to share what I have been up to, and interesting things I have discovered. Since this is a tech and developer blog, my weekly recap posts on this blog would be tech-focused.

## Quarterly School Gathering and Open Day

This had been a busy week at school. On Wednesday, my school — a Malaysian campus of [42 the computer science school](/topics/42-the-school/) was hosting its first quarterly school gathering in 2026, where the campus staff shared updates and announced upcoming events at the school.

On Saturday, my campus hosted the year's first quarterly Open Day. Some classmates and I volunteered to help to welcome newcomers to learn about our school on that day.

On my end, at the moment, I am the one who has progressed the furthest in our core curriculum among my classmates, with my current projects being about Python fundamentals. In addition, I was invited by the campus staff to take part in a student showcase in an upcoming event on January 28, when the school engages with industry partners, to present one of my projects and share my 42 school journey. Two other classmates were also invited to present their projects and shared their experience during the event.

## Pushing My Git Repositories to SourceTube

[omg.lol](https://home.omg.lol/) [launched SourceTube](https://omglol.news/2025/11/20/say-hello-to-sourcetube-the-omg-lol-community-code-forge), a [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org/) instance for the omg.lol community.

I registered an account on SourceTube as soon as it launched, though I only started to push the Git repositories of my personal projects, including this website, to SourceTube. I love omg.lol, its community, and I have a lifetime membership, so I would like to make good use of omg.lol's services as much as possible.

Not to mention, while I am already hosting [my own instance of Gitea](https://git.helenchong.dev/helenchong), of which Forgejo is a fork of, it is a good idea to have multiple copies of your Git repositories just in case you lost one of the copies. Fortunately, you can configure your Git repositories to to multiple remote repositories at the same time.

## Web Browsing Highlights

Interesting things I have discovered on the web this week:

- A [Kickstarter campaign for creating a .meow top-level domain](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dotmeow/meow-next-round-gtld-application), where the profits would be used to fund the LGBTQIA+ community. The campaign's fundraising goal was achieved! I wholeheartedly support the mission, and I hope dotMeow Foundation's application to ICANN to launch and operate the .meow TLD goes well.
