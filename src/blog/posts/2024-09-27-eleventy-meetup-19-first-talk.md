On 26 September 2024, I gave my first talk at a tech event at Episode 19 of THE Eleventy Meetup!

After I published a blog post, ["Aboard the Eleventy 3.0 Train"](2024-07-19-eleventy-3-0-upgrade.md), about my process of upgrading Eleventy 2.0 to Eleventy 3.0 for this website in July 2024, I received an invitation that asked me if I wanted to speak at the next [Eleventy Meetup](https://11tymeetup.dev/) about migrating to Eleventy 3.0. This was a great surprise, since I was not even a professional developer yet at the time, and thus had not been a speaker at any tech event before.

That said, as I was already aspiring to become a web developer back then, I figured that speaking at a tech event would be a great opportunity in my developer journey, especially since it would be about Eleventy, which had become my favourite tool for building websites since I discovered it and [rebuilt my website with it in April 2024](2024-04-11-rebuilding-my-developer-portfolio-with-eleventy.md), so I gladly accepted the invitation to be a speaker at THE Eleventy Meetup. I did end up getting my first developer job in August as well.

Eventually, on September 10, [THE Eleventy Meetup Episode 19](https://11tymeetup.dev/events/ep-19-migrating-to-3-0-and-blogging-with-storyblok/) was announced to take place on September 26, 6:00 AM CDT. It was decided that this time, the meetup would be switching time zones for a time slot that is more Asia-Pacific-, Europe-, and Africa-friendly. Here in Malaysia, the meetup would be at 7 pm.

Thank you [Sia Karamalegos](https://sia.codes/) for organising Episode 19 of THE Eleventy Meetup. Thank you [Estela Franco](https://estelafranco.com/) for your talk about and presentation of [using Storyblok to build an Eleventy blog site](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3Pz1AH6SCY). Thank you to everyone who attended the meetup. Thank you everyone who has left supportive and encouraging messages for my talk in the chat.
