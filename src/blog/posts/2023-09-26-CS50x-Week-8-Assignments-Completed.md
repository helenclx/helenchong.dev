At last, I completed and submitted [Week 8](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/weeks/8/) assignments of the CS50's Introduction to Computer Science (CS50x) course, including [Lab 8](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/labs/8/) and [Problem Set 8](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/8/).

The eighth week of the CS50x is about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and how the internet works. I already have a good foundation in HTML, CSS and JavaScript since I started taking front-end web development courses on other platforms like freeCodeCamp and Scrimba since December 2022. Even then, I learned new things about how the internet works from the CS50x course.

As for the assignments, I already completed and submitted Lab 8 on September 13, but it took almost two weeks after submitting Lab 8 for me to finally finish Problem Set 8, because I was struggling to come out of ideas about what to put on my pages to meet CS50x's requirement. I was relieved when I finally finished Problem Set 8.
