On 8 September 2023, I completed [Week 7](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/weeks/7/) of [CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/) (CS50x) course, by submitting the required assignments, [Lab 7](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/labs/7/) and [Problem Set 7](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/7/).

Week 7 of the CS50x course revolved around SQL. Since I was focusing on learning about front-end web development, this was the first time I learned SQL and relational database. At first, I was worried about tackling this week's assignments due to my lack of familiarity to SQL.

However, it turned out SQL and working on databases was more fun than I expected. I had a good time in writing out the SQL queries to solve this week's assigned problems. In particular, I found my new favourite assignment from CS50x in the [Fiftyville](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/7/fiftyville/) problem, which involved using SQL to solve a mystery of a theft of the CS50 Duck. I had a great deal of fun with the Fiftyville problem from start to finish, from writing my SQL queries and comments about my thought process in solving the mysteries, to narrowing down the suspects and eventually identifying the thief and their accomplice. Kudos to those who designed this fun and challenging assignment!

Now that I am done with Week 7 of CS50x, I am ready to move on to next week, which will be about HTML, CSS and JavaScript — the languages I had spent the past eight months in learning and practicing through various courses outside CS50. CS50x Week 8 here I come!
