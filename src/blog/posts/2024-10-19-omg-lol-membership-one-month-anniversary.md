19 October 2024 marks my one-month anniversary of joining [omg.lol](https://home.omg.lol/).

I discovered of the existence of omg.lol for the first time when I became more active in exploring personal websites in 2023, after I learned about the resurgence of personal websites in 2022. I was quickly intrigued by omg.lol for its fun name (OMG LOL!), cute logo (named [Prami](https://prami.omg.lol/)), and the offer of various web services including a web address, a profile page, status update log, a Mastodon account, PURLs, pastebin, community chat, and more, for an affordable price of US $20 per year.

Furthermore, since I already started using the static site generator [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) to build my own websites at the time, another fact about omg.lol that caught my attention was the fact that a few Eleventy users are also omg.lol members, including [Robb Knight](https://rknight.me/), who is also part of [omg.lol's staff](https://home.omg.lol/staff).

At first, however, I did not feel that I had a use of an omg.lol membership yet, since I already had my own websites and at least one Mastodon account. Therefore, I did not immediately join omg.lol, though I still checked out the platform from time to time, because I did find what omg.lol does interesting, by offering people to claim their own space on the internet. Learning that omg.lol also offered [membership sponsorships](https://home.omg.lol/info/sponsorships) for members of marginalised groups made me respect omg.lol even more.

Then, in September 2024, I learned that omg.lol was hosting a [fundraising campaign for the St. Jude Childrenâ€™s Research Hospital](https://omglol.news/2024/08/28/supporting-st-jude-with-a-month-of-awesomeness), which includes discounts for omg.lol membership fee and daily auction for lifetime omg.lol address. This time, I began to seriously consider joining omg.lol for real, as this was an opportunity to not only obtain an omg.lol membership, but also support a good cause for children. At last, I joined omg.lol after successfully bidding a lifetime address in the auction and registering my `helenchong.omg.lol` address!

After setting up my [omg.lol profile page](https://helenchong.omg.lol/), I began to connect with the omg.lol community by joining the community chat, Discourse forum and the [social.lol](https://social.lol/) Mastodon instance, and I have been enjoying my time in omg.lol's wonderful community since. [Adam Newbold](https://adam.omg.lol/), the founder of omg.lol himself, is also a really nice guy who is pleasant to talk to.

To make more good use out of my omg.lol address, and the fact that you can configure the DNS of your omg.lol address, I have also created a [blog.helenchong.omg.lol](https://blog.helenchong.omg.lol/) subdomain to use it as the address of my new personal blog, Galaxy Garden. It is worth noting that I was inspired to have a personal blog again by other bloggers in the omg.lol community.

I am incredibly grateful that services like omg.lol exist to bring back the fun of carving your own corner on the web, and I am proud to be a member of omg.lol and its delightful community. I am following omg.lol's development and looking forward to what it has in store for the future.
