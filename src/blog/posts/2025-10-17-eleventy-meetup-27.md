On 15 October 2025, I spoke at [Episode 27](https://11tymeetup.dev/events/ep-27-11ty-at-the-museum-and-multilingual-blogs/) of [THE Eleventy Meetup](https://11tymeetup.dev/), about building a multilingual blog with Eleventy.

This marked my second time speaking at THE Eleventy Meetup, after [Episode 19 of the meetup](2024-09-27-eleventy-meetup-19-first-talk.md) in September 2024, which was also when I spoke at a tech event for the first time.

Unfortunately, just when I was about to start delivering my talk, I encountered technical issues with sharing my screen on Zoom's Linux desktop app. As a result, I had to switch to using Zoom's web app so I could share my screen. Special thanks to the meetup attendees and the Eleventy community for being patient with me as I tried to sort out my technical issues.

I had also enjoyed [Nic Chan](https://nicchan.me/)'s talk at the meetup about [using Eleventy to power a museum's digital infrastructure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRqnRCXBpzY).

Once again, thank you [Sia Karamalegos](https://sia.codes/) for organising THE Eleventy Meetup. Thank you to everyone who attended the meetup. Thank you everyone who has left supportive and encouraging messages for my talk.
