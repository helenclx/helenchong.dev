On the past Sunday, the RGB backlight of my Limeide GTX300 USB mechanical gaming keyboard that is plugged in to my main computer, which is a gaming laptop, suddenly stopped working.

When I ordered and received Limeide GTX300 from a Malaysian store through Shopee back in September 2025, I did not expect that the RGB backlight did not work out-of-the-box on my Arch Linux operating system, so I had to [configure my Linux system manually to get the RGB backlight working](2025-09-26-limeide-gtx300-backlight-linux.md) after searching the web for solutions.

My configuration worked until the last Sunday. After investigating it myself, I realised that a system update I recently performed somehow caused my system to "reset" the device ID of my Limeide GTX300 keyboard, thus unable to properly detect the keyboard to turn on the RGB backlight.

To be honest, I had been kind of regretting buying this keyboard, because not only that the RGB backlight did not work on Linux out-of-the-box, but also the design of the keys made it difficult to read the key characters without the backlight. Therefore, I decided to look for a new USB keyboard.

After searching Shopee, I chose a different model of Limeide's USB mechanical gaming keyboard — Limeide K21 Mechanical Storm, which also has RGB backlight, but one where the key characters can still be read even without the backlight. After placing my order on last Sunday, my Limeide K21 Mechanical Storm arrived at my house two days later on Tuesday.

When I tested my brand new Limeide K21 Mechanical Storm, I was pleased to find out that unlike GTX300, K21's RGB backlight worked on my Linux system out-of-the-gate, and I could freely turn the backlight on and off with the designated backlight key.

While waiting for Limeide K21 to arrive at my house, the backlight of my Limeide GTX300 worked again after I performed a new system update on my computer. Therefore, for now I am still using Limeide GTX300, but I am glad I at least have an extra mechanical gaming keyboard in case I actually need to replace my current USB keyboard one day.
