On 21 April 2024, I have added a [now page](/now) to this website.

The idea of adding a "now page" was inspired by the website [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com/), which [defines](https://nownownow.com/about) a now page as a page that tells you what this person is focused on at this point in their life. In addition, I also have [my own profile on nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com/p/D9En).

As an aspiring web developer, a now page on my developer portfolio website serves as a means to inform the public about my current priorities and projects.

My /now page can be updated at any time, so feel free to check the page out when you visit this website!
