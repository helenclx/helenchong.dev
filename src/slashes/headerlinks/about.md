## Introduction

Greetings! I am Helen Chong (they/she), a web developer from Malaysia. Previously, I had worked for 8 years as a graphic designer. Now I decided to transfer my creativity and problem-solving skills into building the web, with a focus on accessibility, inclusive design and progressive enhancement to improve user experience.

## My Web Development Origin

I have been interested in computers and the World Wide Web, as well as learning how to use them since I was a child. Later as a teenager, I learned about the existence of blogs, and began blogging as a hobby, which led me to learn HTML and CSS to customise blog themes and widgets. I was already fascinated by web design, however I was unaware if web design could be a viable career path at the time, so I used my interest in design to pursue an education and later career in graphic design.

Fast forward to 2022, discovering the resurgence of creating personal websites inspired me to relearn HTML and CSS. This time, I also dabbled in JavaScript. Eventually, my interest in web design and development grew enough to make me consider pursuing web development as a profession, thus I started taking online coding courses, starting with freeCodeCamp and Scrimba.

After nearly two years of teaching myself to code without a computer science degree, I got my first developer job in August 2024, by handling WordPress development, UX design and graphic design for a local traditional Chinese medicine healthcare company.
