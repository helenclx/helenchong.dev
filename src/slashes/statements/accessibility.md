I take accessibility seriously. I want visitors to my website to have the best possible experience of browsing my website. Therefore, I strive to design this website to be accessible, including to disabled and neurodivergent people, by aiming to meet [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 Level AA standards](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).

High-level overview of the accessibility features of this site:

* Responsive design and mobile-friendly layout.
* Semantic HTML, enhanced by Web Accessibility Initiative â€“ Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA).
* Sufficient colour contrast between text and background colours.
* Alt text for all non-decorative images.
* Keyboard navigation-friendly: Every interactive element can be focused and interacted with keyboard buttons, with visible outline when focused.
* Logical content and heading flow.
* Links to skip to the main content or the top of the page.
* Sufficient font size that can be enlarged without breaking the site layout.
* No autoplaying audio or video.
* A button below code blocks to copy code snippets (requires JavaScript enabled in the browser).

I use the following tools to test my site for accessibility:

* [axe DevTools - Web Accessibility Testing](https://www.deque.com/axe/browser-extensions/) browser extension
* WebAIM's [WAVE Browser Extension](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/)
* [Alex Clapperton's Colour Contrast Checker](https://colourcontrast.cc/)
* [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/about-nvda/) screen reader for Windows
* TalkBack screen reader for Android

In addition, I test the accessibility of my website manually by navigating with keyboard alone.

Feedbacks and suggestions for improving the accessibility of this website are welcome. Feel free to [contact me](/contact) for it.
