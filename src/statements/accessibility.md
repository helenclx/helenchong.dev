I take accessibility seriously. I want every visitor to my website to have the best possible experience of browsing my website. Therefore, I strive to design this website to be accessible, including to disabled and neurodivergent people, by aiming to meet [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 Level AA standards](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).

I use the following tools to test my site for accessibility:
* WebAIM's [WAVE Browser Extension](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/)
* [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/about-nvda/) screen reader for Windows

In addition, I test the accessibility of my website manually by navigating with keyboard alone.

Feedbacks and suggestions for improving the accessibility of this site are welcome. You can [contact me via email](mailto:{{sitemeta.siteAuthor.email}}).
