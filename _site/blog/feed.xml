            <title>CS50x Week 9 Completed</title>
            <link href="https://helenclx.github.io/blog/posts/2024-04-15-cs50x-week-9-completed/"/>

            <id>https://helenclx.github.io/blog/posts/2024-04-15-cs50x-week-9-completed/</id>
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At last, on 5 March 2024, I completed &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/weeks/9/&quot;&gt;Week 9&lt;/a&gt; of the CS50&#39;s Introduction to Computer Science (CS50x) course, by submitting my solutions to &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/9/&quot;&gt;Problem Set 9&lt;/a&gt; . In other words, I have finished all assignments for the CS50x course, with the only thing left for me to do to complete the course is building and submitting my own &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/project/&quot;&gt;final project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem Set 9 consisted of two problems, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/9/birthdays/&quot;&gt;Birthdays&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/9/finance/&quot;&gt;Finance&lt;/a&gt;, which required Python, Flask and SQL to solve. I did and submitted my solution to the Birthdays problem on 6 January 2024. At the time, I already took a break from the CS50x course for a few months to pursue other front-end web development courses. It was rather challenging to go back to CS50x and do its assignments after taking a break from the course for a while. My SQL and Flask knowledge got rusty due to rarely using them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 2 March 2024, I began tackling the Finance problem. As the final assignment for the course before the final project, Finance was by far the largest assignment of CS50x. As I expected, this project challenged me to apply everything I learned from the CS50x course. I needed to refer to my solutions to the previous problems to refresh my skills of Python, Flask and SQL. Thankfully, I had a good start; on my first day doing the Finance problem, I successfully implemented the Register and Quote features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, I started implementing the feature to buy stocks by setting up and testing input elements. After a lot of research and trial and errors, I learned to use &lt;code&gt;try...except&lt;/code&gt; to display an error message on the web page if an incorrect input is entered. I also learned to make use of the phpLiteAdmin installed in the CS50 Codespace to work on the project’s database and get the SQL commands I want to use, and modify the database in a graphical user interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the third day of me doing the Finance problem, I successfully implemented the features to buy stocks and displaying the user’s owned stocks on the index page. My work on this project allowed me to refresh my knowledge and skills of SQL, by creating new tables, inserting new rows into tables, and updating data of existing tables. I also got more practice in working with Flask by dynamically render HTML elements via Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 5 March 2024, I successfully implemented not only the last required features to sell stocks and display transaction history, but also additional features, namely to add cash to the user’s account and change the user’s password. On my last day working on the Finance assignment specifically, I learned about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the timestamp based on local time zone in SQL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The flash message function in Flask&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use both the &lt;code&gt;round()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;float()&lt;/code&gt; functions to round a number to a certain amount of decimals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;code&gt;steps&lt;/code&gt; attribute of HTML’s &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;select&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I completed and submitted the Finance problem from Week 9 of CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a video demonstration of my completed Finance project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYkO59_Ojb4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working on this assignment allowed me to practice and learn SQL, Python and Flask a lot. By finishing Week 9 of the CS50x, I reached another milestone.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Round 1 of 100 Days of Code Challenge Completed</title>
            <link href="https://helenclx.github.io/blog/posts/2024-04-13-round-1-100-days-of-code-challenge-completed/"/>
            <updated>2024-04-13T00:00:00Z</updated>
            <id>https://helenclx.github.io/blog/posts/2024-04-13-round-1-100-days-of-code-challenge-completed/</id>
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On 3 January 2024, I started the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.100daysofcode.com/&quot;&gt;#100DaysOfCode&lt;/a&gt; challenge for the first time. Came 11 April 2024, I finally completed my first round of the challenge!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had heard of the 100 Days of Code challenge after I started my journey to learn to code. However, I did not participate in it until reading freeCodeCamp&#39;s article &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/100daysofcode-challenge-2024-discord/&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;#100DaysOfCode Challenge for 2024 – Discord Edition&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;. This was also how I found out about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-crazy-history-of-the-100daysofcode-challenge-and-why-you-should-try-it-for-2018-6c89a76e298d/&quot;&gt;history of the challenge&lt;/a&gt;, and the fact that the challenge was created by a freeCodeCamp alumni, which I found interesting as an aspiring developer to start to properly learn to code with freeCodeCamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time 2024 came around, I had been taking coding courses for more than a year, so I figured the 100 Days of Code challenge would be a good motivator for me to continue my coding journey every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It helped that there were still coding courses for me to take. At the time, freeCodeCamp just recently upgraded their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-javascript-with-new-data-structures-and-algorithms-certification-projects/&quot;&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-curriculum-upgrade/&quot;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; curriculum to be project-based. I already earned the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/helenclx/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures&quot;&gt;Legacy JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification&lt;/a&gt;, but since I prefer to learn to code by building projects, I decided to take freeCodeCamp&#39;s upgraded curriculum, and eventually earned the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/helenclx/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8&quot;&gt;new freeCodeCamp JavaScript certification&lt;/a&gt; on 16 March 2024 as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I also started to enrol &lt;a href=&quot;https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend&quot;&gt;Scrimba&#39;s Frontend Developer Career Path&lt;/a&gt; after earning a one-year Scrimba Pro plan from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://helenclx.github.io/blog/posts/2023-12-27-JavaScriptmas-2023-Challenge-Completed-and-Won&quot;&gt;JavaScriptmas challenge&lt;/a&gt; in December 2023. By the time I completed my first round of the #100DaysOfCode challenge, I had also completed more than half of the curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I committed to the 100 Days of Code challenge by sharing updates every day on Twitter, Mastodon, Bluesky and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://discord.gg/freecodecamp&quot;&gt;official freeCodeCamp Discord server&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, I made the habit of recording my progress in the 100 Days of Code challenge every day, so I can reflect on my coding journey. You can view &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/helenclx/100-days-of-code&quot;&gt;my fork of the #100DaysOfCode challenge repository&lt;/a&gt; to read the log of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/helenclx/100-days-of-code/blob/master/r1-log.md&quot;&gt;Round 1&lt;/a&gt; of the challenge. You can fork the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code&quot;&gt;official repository of the #100DaysOfCode challenge&lt;/a&gt; to log your own progress in the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the #100DaysOfCode challenge, visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.100daysofcode.com/&quot;&gt;its official website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The #100DaysOfCode challenge has been a wonderful journey. I am glad I managed to motivate myself to code every day. Through various courses and projects, I have honed my front-end development skills a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone who has supported me throughout my 100 Days of Code journey, and has interacted with my posts on Twitter, Mastodon, Bluesky and the freeCodeCamp Discord serve, by replying to, liking or reposting.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Rebuilding My Developer Portfolio with Eleventy</title>
            <link href="https://helenclx.github.io/blog/posts/2024-04-11-rebuilding-my-developer-portfolio-with-eleventy/"/>
            <updated>2024-04-11T00:00:00Z</updated>
            <id>https://helenclx.github.io/blog/posts/2024-04-11-rebuilding-my-developer-portfolio-with-eleventy/</id>
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have been taking courses to learn to code, starting from HTML, CSS and JavaScript, since December 2022. As I honed my front-end web development skills further by building projects, I quickly realised that I needed a portfolio website to showcase myself and my projects. Eventually, I launched my first developer portfolio website in February 2023, based on Kolade Chris tutorial &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-developer-portfolio-website/&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;How to Build Your Own Developer Portfolio Website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; on freeCodeCamp, and deployed it to GitHub Pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://helenclx.github.io/assets/images/posts/rebuilding-my-developer-portfolio-with-eleventy/Helen-Chong-portfolio-old.png&quot; alt=&quot;First version of Helen Chong&#39;s developer portfolio&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/helen_clx/status/1621696817795854336&quot;&gt;shared the first version of my developer portfolio website on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, my tweet was liked and replied to by both &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ossia/status/1621729431009071104&quot;&gt;Quincy Larson&lt;/a&gt;, the founder of freeCodeCamp, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Ksound22/status/1621739428057079808&quot;&gt;Kolade Chris&lt;/a&gt; themselves, despite me not even tagging freeCodeCamp nor Kolade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://helenclx.github.io/assets/images/posts/rebuilding-my-developer-portfolio-with-eleventy/Quincy-Larson-Kolade-Chris-tweet-replies.png&quot; alt=&quot;Quincy Larson and Kolade Chris&#39; replies to my tweet&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my front-end web development skills grew, I made my own improvements to the code of my portfolio website, most notably revamping the CSS to a mobile-first approach. In August 2023, I also &lt;a href=&quot;https://helenclx.github.io/blog/posts/2023-08-21-Welcome-to-Helen-Codes&quot;&gt;launched my tech and coding blog&lt;/a&gt; to document my coding learnings and talk about various tech topics. At first, I tried to build my blog with a Jekyll template in a separate repository, but switched to &lt;a href=&quot;https://zonelets.net/&quot;&gt;Zonelets&lt;/a&gt;, so I can write and manage my blog in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, languages I was already familiar with, and moved my blog to my portfolio website&#39;s own repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, as my portfolio website grew, I began to realise that writing all the code by hand makes a website tedious to maintain and update, especially if the website also includes a blog, since making new blog posts would require copy and pasting the same HTML heading over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started to research for ways to dynamically build a website, and as a result, I discovered more about static site generators (SSGs). I first heard of static site generators through GitHub and Jekyll, but I abandoned Jekyll after my brief attempt in building my blog with it, because Ruby is not a language I am familiar with, not to mention inconvenient to set up on Windows. Fortunately, I eventually discovered the ultimate solution to my problem: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.11ty.dev/&quot;&gt;Eleventy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eleventy, often abbreviated as 11ty, stands out among other SSGs in its flexibility. It not only supports many template languages including HTML, Markdown, JavaScript, Nunjucks, Liquid, and even having its own web component template called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/webc/&quot;&gt;WebC&lt;/a&gt;, but also allows users to mix and match different template languages to build their own static websites. I like to be able to have control over how I build my own projects, which makes Eleventy an attractive option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, my Eleventy journey began. After reading the official Eleventy documentation and community Eleventy tutorials, as well as following along the tutorials, I created a new branch on my portfolio website repository to recreate my website and blog from scratch, based on Gerard Hynes&#39; tutorial &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-eleventy/&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Learn the Eleventy Static Site Generator by Building and Deploying a Portfolio Website&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt; on freeCodeCamp and Raymond Camden&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://cfjedimaster.github.io/eleventy-blog-guide/guide.html&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;A Complete Guide to Building a Blog with Eleventy&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, then migrating my website&#39;s content and blog posts to Eleventy. I also look at Eleventy&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog&quot;&gt;official blog starter project&lt;/a&gt; for inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, on 9 April 2024, I succeed in rebuilding my developer portfolio website in Eleventy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://helenclx.github.io/assets/images/posts/rebuilding-my-developer-portfolio-with-eleventy/Helen-Chong-portfolio-eleventy.png&quot; alt=&quot;Helen Chong&#39;s new developer portfolio&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a static site generator to build my own websites has been a great learning experience, from creating layouts, templates, installing plug-ins, to setting up GitHub Actions. I am glad that I have learned a great tool to build and maintain my static website projects in a dynamic, flexible and efficient manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Helen Chong&#39;s brand new Eleventy portfolio website!🎉&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>JavaScriptmas 2023 Challenge Completed — and Won</title>
            <link href="https://helenclx.github.io/blog/posts/2023-12-27-JavaScriptmas-2023-Challenge-Completed-and-Won/"/>
            <updated>2023-12-27T00:00:00Z</updated>
            <id>https://helenclx.github.io/blog/posts/2023-12-27-JavaScriptmas-2023-Challenge-Completed-and-Won/</id>
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Starting from 1 December 2023, I had participated in &lt;a href=&quot;https://scrimba.com/&quot;&gt;Scrimba&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://scrimba.com/learn/javascriptmas&quot;&gt;JavaScriptmas&lt;/a&gt; challenge. After 24 days, I finally completed the entire challenge! I have compiled a &lt;a href=&quot;https://scrimba.com/playlist/pdpB3JZfE&quot;&gt;scrim playlist&lt;/a&gt; for all my JavaScriptmas solutions on Scrimba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, when Scrimba announced the winners of JavaScriptmas in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/live/Y0tc4DTS0e8&quot;&gt;JavaScriptmas PrizeFest&lt;/a&gt; livestream on 24 December, it was revealed that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/live/Y0tc4DTS0e8?t=2190&quot;&gt;I (under my Twitter handle helen_clx) was one of the 24 winners of a one-year Scrimba Pro plan&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://scrimba.com/scrim/co79e43dcbacb329c01a1744f?pl=pdpB3JZfE&quot;&gt;my solution to the Day 18 challenge&lt;/a&gt;: AI alt text generator!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://helenclx.github.io/assets/images/posts/JavaScriptmas-2023-Challenge-Completed-and-Won/JavaScriptmas-PrizeFest-2023-Day-18-winner.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of JavaScriptmas PrizeFest announcing helen_clx as the Day 18 winner&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JavaScriptmas has been a great opportunity to practice and sharpen my CSS and JavaScript knowledge and skills. The AI challenges, including Day 18, which I won, were also the first time I learned to incorporate AI in coding projects. Therefore, it was a great surprise that I managed to win for an AI challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you Scrimba for the Christmas gift! With a one-year Scrimba Pro plan, I will be able to take Scirmba courses that are only available to subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Chingu Voyage 46 Completed</title>
            <link href="https://helenclx.github.io/blog/posts/2023-11-25-Chingu-Voyage-46-Completed/"/>
            <updated>2023-11-25T00:00:00Z</updated>
            <id>https://helenclx.github.io/blog/posts/2023-11-25-Chingu-Voyage-46-Completed/</id>
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On 12 November 2023, I, along with two other teammates had officially completed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chingu.io/&quot;&gt;Chingu&lt;/a&gt; Voyage 46. I received my &lt;a href=&quot;https://helenclx.github.io/assets/documents/Chingu-Voyage46-Completion-Cert.pdf&quot;&gt;Certificate of Completion&lt;/a&gt; (PDF file) from Chingu on 19 November 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in August, I had created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://helenclx.github.io/blog/posts/2023-11-25-Chingu-Voyage-46-Completed/2023-08-24-Built-a-TickyBot-Clone-for-Chingus-Solo-Project&quot;&gt;TickyBot clone&lt;/a&gt; as my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chingu-voyages/Handbook/blob/main/docs/guides/soloproject/soloproject.md&quot;&gt;solo project&lt;/a&gt; to submit to Chingu in order to join the next Chingu Voyage, specifically Tier 1, which is for web development beginners. My submission was approved by Chingu, and I was assigned to Tier 1 Team 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were instructed to build a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chingu-voyages/voyage-project-tier1-recipes&quot;&gt;recipe app&lt;/a&gt; that allows users to search for recipes by inputting ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chingu-voyages/v46-tier1-team-01/main/Recipe-Hub-screenshot.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of Recipe Hub&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can view our Recipe Hub app&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://chingu-voyages.github.io/v46-tier1-team-01/Food-Recipe/&quot;&gt;live site&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chingu-voyages/v46-tier1-team-01&quot;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chingu Voyage was a big help to me for gaining practical experience in working on group projects, and learning both hard and soft skills. Particupating in the Chingu Voyage allowed me to practice not only my HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills, but also my teamwork and communication skills that are needed in group projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before joining Chingu, I already practice my front-end web development skills with my own projects and Frontend Mentor&#39;s challenges, but since those were all solo projects, participating in my first Chingu Voyage, which was Voyage 46, was a new experience for me.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>cbpickaxe and My First (Merged) Pull Request in Python</title>
            <link href="https://helenclx.github.io/blog/posts/2023-11-13-My-First-PR-in-Python/"/>
            <updated>2023-11-13T00:00:00Z</updated>
            <id>https://helenclx.github.io/blog/posts/2023-11-13-My-First-PR-in-Python/</id>
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently, on 11 November 2023, I created my first pull request in Python that got merged later. Specifically, the pull request was for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ExcaliburZero/cbpickaxe&quot;&gt;cbpickaxe&lt;/a&gt;, a Python library and set of scripts for data mining the video game &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cassettebeasts.com/&quot;&gt;Cassette Beasts&lt;/a&gt;, titled &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ExcaliburZero/cbpickaxe/pull/3&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;extract_translation Script: Add support for finding strings of IDs that require pronoun identifiers&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While my current focus in my developer journey is front-end web development, I have also been learning Python at the same time, due to the programming language&#39;s popularity and the vast amount of resources and tutorials for learning the language. In addition, as an open source enthusiast, I have always wanted to be able to contribute to open source projects, particularly ones that I use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cassette Beasts, the independent monster collecting role-playing game developed by Bytten Studio, has become one of my all-time favourite video games since the first time I played it. My interest in the game drives me to learn as much about the game as possible, which led me to start using cbpickaxe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started using the &lt;code&gt;extract_translation&lt;/code&gt; script to data mine in-game dialogues, I discovered the script&#39;s issue of not being able to extract strings with gender identifiers. After discussing the issue with ExcaliburZero, the developer of cbpickaxe, I started investigating the script&#39;s code and tried to figure out any solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had little experience with writing Python scripts, so I saw this as a great learning opportunity for me to put my Python knowledge and skills into practice. After forking the cbpickaxe repository, looking into the code and a lot of web searching, I discovered that in the original code, printing the output of the IDs with missing strings only has one key (&lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;) in its list, and does not have any locale key to display the corresponding strings. Therefore, I started thinking of possible solutions from there:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check if the string ID does not have the locale key, by using this condition: &lt;code&gt;if locale not in row.keys()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check if the string ID only has one key (id), by using this condition: &lt;code&gt;if len(row.keys()) == 1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After trying both possible methods, I eventually settled for the second one, because it allowed me to write cleaner and more succinct code, while the first required me to write more bloated code, mainly due to having to repeat the block of code for searching and reading strings from in-game data, as refactoring it into a function meant losing the definition of the locale variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, I spent time in figuring out how to append the pronoun identifiers to the input IDs, so their corresponding strings can be written in the output CSV. At first, I considered trying to dynamically reading the &lt;code&gt;analysis.tres&lt;/code&gt; file from the decompiled Cassette Beasts game, but the text structure of the &lt;code&gt;.tres&lt;/code&gt; files might be too complicated to be doable in a clean code, so I chose to create a list for the pronoun identifiers (&lt;code&gt;.f&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.m&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.n&lt;/code&gt;), then the script will iterate through the pronouns list to append the pronoun identifiers to the end of the ID if it requires a pronoun idntifier to find the corresponding string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voilà! At last, I solved the problem!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After testing my code multiple times to ensure it works, I made a pull request on cbpickaxe&#39;s GitHub repository. ExcaliburZero approved and merged my pull request, which has become my first merged pull request on Python! This pull request has been included in the release of cbpickaxe starting from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ExcaliburZero/cbpickaxe/releases/tag/v0.1.2&quot;&gt;version 0.1.2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am immensely grateful of this opportunity to not only contribute to an open source project that is realated to one of my favourite video games, but also practicing my Python skills.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>CS50x Week 8 Assignments Completed</title>

            <id>https://helenclx.github.io/blog/posts/2023-09-26-CS50x-Week-8-Assignments-Completed/</id>
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At last, I completed and submitted &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/weeks/8/&quot;&gt;Week 8&lt;/a&gt; assignments of the CS50&#39;s Introduction to Computer Science (CS50x) course, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/labs/8/&quot;&gt;Lab 8&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/8/&quot;&gt;Problem Set 8&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eighth week of the CS50x is about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and how the internet works. I already have a good foundation in HTML, CSS and JavaScript since I started taking front-end web development courses on other platforms like freeCodeCamp and Scrimba since December 2022. Even then, I learned new things about how the internet works from the CS50x course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the assignments, I already completed and submitted Lab 8 on September 13, but it took almost two weeks after submitting Lab 8 for me to finally finish Problem Set 8, because I was struggling to come out of ideas about what to put on my pages to meet CS50x&#39;s requirement. I was relieved when I finally finished Problem Set 8.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>CS50x Week 7 Completed</title>
            <link href="https://helenclx.github.io/blog/posts/2023-09-10-CS50x-Week-7-Completed/"/>

            <id>https://helenclx.github.io/blog/posts/2023-09-10-CS50x-Week-7-Completed/</id>
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On 8 September 2023, I completed &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/weeks/7/&quot;&gt;Week 7&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/&quot;&gt;CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science&lt;/a&gt; (CS50x) course, by submitting the required assignments, &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/labs/7/&quot;&gt;Lab 7&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/7/&quot;&gt;Problem Set 7&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Week 7 of the CS50x course revolved around SQL. Since I was focusing on learning about front-end web development, this was the first time I learned SQL and relational database. At first, I was worried about tackling this week&#39;s assignments due to my lack of familiarity to SQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it turned out SQL and working on databases was more fun than I expected. I had a good time in writing out the SQL queries to solve this week&#39;s assigned problems. In particular, I found my new favourite assignment from CS50x in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/psets/7/fiftyville/&quot;&gt;Fiftyville&lt;/a&gt; problem, which involved using SQL to solve a mystery of a theft of the CS50 Duck. I had a great deal of fun with the Fiftyville problem from start to finish, from writing my SQL queries and comments about my thought process in solving the mysteries, to narrowing down the suspects and eventually identifying the thief and their accomplice. Kudos to those who designed this fun and challenging assignment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I am done with Week 7 of CS50x, I am ready to move on to next week, which will be about HTML, CSS and JavaScript — the languages I had spent the past eight months in learning and practicing through various courses outside CS50. CS50x Week 8 here I come!&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Built A TickyBot Clone for Chingu&#39;s Solo Projects</title>
            <link href="https://helenclx.github.io/blog/posts/2023-08-24-Built-a-TickyBot-Clone-for-Chingus-Solo-Project/"/>

            <id>https://helenclx.github.io/blog/posts/2023-08-24-Built-a-TickyBot-Clone-for-Chingus-Solo-Project/</id>
            <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On 11 August 2023, I decided to join &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chingu.io/&quot;&gt;Chingu&lt;/a&gt; after discovering its existence through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chingu.io/&quot;&gt;Scrimba Podcast&lt;/a&gt;, specifically &lt;a href=&quot;https://scrimba.com/podcast/are-you-a-new-developer-follow-this-one-tip-with-scrimba-student-danny/&quot;&gt;Episode 127&lt;/a&gt;. I have learned coding since December 2022, and one of the challenges aspiring self-taught developers face is gaining practical experience that can prepare them for developer jobs, so when I discovered Chingu, I thought it could be an opportunity for me to gain experience in working in group developer projects, thus I registered on the platform and joined the Chingu community on Discord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step needed to start participating in Chingu&#39;s projects is to submit a solo project for approval. I chose to build a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chingu-voyages/soloproject-tier1-tickybot-clone&quot;&gt;TickyBot Clone&lt;/a&gt; using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. On 21 August, I finished coding &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/helenclx/TickyBot-Clone&quot;&gt;my TickyBot Clone&lt;/a&gt; and submitted the project to Chingu. On the next day, my solo project was approved by Chingu, to my great delight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helenclx/TickyBot-Clone/main/screenshot-tickybot-clone.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot of my TickyBot clone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can view my TickyBot Clone&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://helenclx.github.io/TickyBot-Clone/&quot;&gt;live site&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/helenclx/TickyBot-Clone&quot;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next step was to sign up for the next Chingu Voyage. I am looking forward to learning to work in a group developer project. Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;
